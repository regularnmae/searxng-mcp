# uv is the only build tool end to end: it turns uv.lock into a
# hash-pinned requirements file, and it installs that file. No pip
# anywhere. The uv binary is copied in from its image, used, and deleted,
# so nothing but Python and the app remain in the image.

# The base is pinned by tag *and* digest: the tag keeps the pin readable and
# gives Renovate a stream to follow, the digest makes a moved tag a no-op
# until a commit bumps it.

# --require-hashes means uv actually enforces them. Both build tools leave
# the image after they are done with it; the lockfiles are inputs to this
# step only, so they go too.
